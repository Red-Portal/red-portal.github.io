I am a first year PhD student advised by Professor [Jacob R. Gardner](https://jacobrgardner.github.io/) at the University of Pennsylvania working on Bayesian machine learning, Bayesian inference, and Bayesian optimization.
I acquired my Bachelor in Engineering degree at Sogang University, South Korea, during which I did undergraduate research under Professor [Hongseok Kim](https://nice.sogang.ac.kr/), [Tai-kyong Song](https://heart.sogang.ac.kr/), [Sungyong Park, and Youngjae Kim](https://discos.sogang.ac.kr/).
During this time, I also worked at Samsung Medical Center, South Korea, as an undergraduate researcher, at Kangbuk Samsung Hospital, South Korea, as a visiting researcher, and at Hansono, South Korea, as a part-time embedded software engineer.
After graduating, I was a research associate at the University of Liverpool under Professor [Simon Maskell](http://www.simonmaskell.com/) and [Jason F. Ralph](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q0xW5igAAAAJ&hl=en).
I hold memberships in the ACM, ISBA, and the IEEE (which implies that I'm a good tipper...)

Previously, I used to work on medical imaging, computer systems, high-performance computing, and array signal processing, but I'm also broadly interested in topics such as computational statistics, programming languages, and optimization.
[Here](https://github.com/Red-Portal/ray-awesome-papers) is a list of papers that I found interesting over my career.


#### **productivity tools that I use**
(Last updated in Dec 11 2022)<br />
I heavily use cross-platform opensource software tools.
* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) (heavily [customized](https://github.com/Red-Portal/.emacs.d)) for writing **code**
  * [Magit](https://magit.vc/) for accessing **Git** within Emacs
* [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) for managing **citations** and exporting bibtex
* [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for drawing vector **diagrams** (but also Tikz if not in a rush)
* [Veusz](https://veusz.github.io/) for quick publication quality **plots** (but also PGFplots, [Makie.jl](https://docs.makie.org/stable/) for fancier stuff).
* [sioyek](https://sioyek.info/) for viewing and [Master PDF](https://code-industry.net/masterpdfeditor/) for editing, and annotating **PDF** files.
* [Nomacs](https://nomacs.org/) for viewing a lot of **image files** quickly (on Windows, [FastStone](https://www.faststone.org/) is hard to beat)
* [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/) for taking **screenshots**
