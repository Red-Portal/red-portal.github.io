  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               The purpose of this study was to develop a software tool and evaluate different T1 map calculation methods in terms of computation time in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.                                         Methods               The modified Look-Locker inversion recovery (MOLLI) sequence was used to acquire multiple inversion time (TI) images for pre- and post-contrast T1 mapping. The T1 map calculation involved pixel-wise curve fitting based on the T1 relaxation model. A variety of methods were evaluated using data from 30 subjects for computational efficiency: MRmap, python Levenberg\textendash Marquardt (LM), python reduced-dimension (RD) non-linear least square, C++ single- and multi-core LM, and C++ single- and multi-core RD.                                         Results               Median (interquartile range) computation time was 126~s (98\textendash 141) for the publicly available software MRmap, 261~s (249\textendash 282) for python LM, 77~s (74\textendash 80) for python RD, 3.4~s (3.1\textendash 3.6) for C++ multi-core LM, and 1.9~s (1.9\textendash 2.0) for C++ multi-core RD. The fastest C++ multi-core RD and the publicly available MRmap showed good agreement of myocardial T1 values, resulting in 95\% Bland\textendash Altman limits of agreement of (-\,0.83 to 0.58~ms) and (-\,6.57 to 7.36~ms) with mean differences of -\,0.13~ms and 0.39~ms, for the pre- and post-contrast, respectively.                                         Conclusion               The C++ multi-core RD was the fastest method on a regular eight-core personal computer for pre- or post-contrast T1 map calculation. The presented software tool (fT1fit) facilitated rapid T1 map and extracellular volume fraction map calculations.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes Hermes, a container-based preemptive GPU scheduling framework for accelerating hyper-parameter optimization in deep learning (DL) clusters. Hermes accelerates hyper-parameter optimization by time-sharing between DL jobs and prioritizing jobs with more promising hyper-parameter combinations. Hermes's scheduling policy is grounded on the observation that good hyper-parameter combinations converge quickly in the early phases of training. By giving higher priority to fast-converging containers, Hermes's GPU preemption mechanism can accelerate training. This enables users to find optimal hyper-parameters faster without losing the progress of a container. We have implemented Hermes over Kubernetes and compared its performance against existing scheduling frameworks. Experiments show that Hermes reduces the time for hyper-parameter optimization up to 4.04 times against previously proposed scheduling policies such as FIFO, round-robin (RR), and SLAQ, with minimal time-sharing overhead.},
